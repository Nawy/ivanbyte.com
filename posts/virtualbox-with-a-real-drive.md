## What? Why?
Let's say, your OS for some readons are broken. Maybe because of broken update or you did something wrong. How can you crash your linux?
Well:
- Delete `cd` command with `sudo rm /bin/cd`
- Corrupt `/etc/profile`
- Corrupt `/etc/passwd`

Also there are many things to do that. Sometimes it's incedential. In my case I did wrong configuration on /etc/profile. The result is impossible to login into the system.

## There is another OS on the same machine
It's the easiest way to fix it. I decided to try loading VirtualBox with a not virtual drive, but with a real one.

### Configuration
Assuming you have VirtualBox installed, or go on their website and download one.
