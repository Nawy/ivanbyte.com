## Why?
Let's imagine you changed something in your linux or updated and it's not starting anymore.

## How?
There a couple of options:
- Boot from previous kernel
- Load a snapshot of your linux (if you have of course)

### Boot from linux distro

#### Physical CD or Flesh Drive
But what if nothing of it is working? Here you can try to boot from linux-distro cd or flesh drive.

#### Guest machine in different OS
