## Introduction
Welcome to my first blog post! Throughout my career, I've experimented with various platforms for my blogs, but it's interesting to note that it all began with a static website where I shared my short poems. Now, with this blog, I find myself using a static site generator once again.

## Curiosity

My quest to add more functionality to my simple static website led me to explore PHP and JavaScript. At the time, jQuery seemed like pure magic, while PHP appeared to be a groundbreaking technology. This curiosity took me far and wide in the world of technology, even leading me to explore other countries, such as Japan.

## Choosing the Right Tool for the Job

Now, I've come to realize the importance of selecting the right tool to achieve my goals. This blog has been built using the 11ty static site generator, and it's been a fantastic choice. 11ty provides exactly what I need for a blog, proving that sometimes it's worth revisiting the simple solutions from our past.

## Examples
For this page I created a simple *.md document that renders into a html later. 
``` markdown
