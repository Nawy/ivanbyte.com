Ivan Ermolaev: A Journey in Software Development
Connect with me on [Twitter][https://twitter.com/ivanbyte] and [YouTube][https://www.youtube.com/@IvanByteVideo]

Greetings, I'm Ivan Ermolaev, a software developer residing in the beautiful Netherlands. I've spent my professional life crafting elegant code in languages such as Java, Rust, C++, and occasionally dabbling in JS using the finest features of Vue, React, and Angular. Lately, Rust has captured my heart and become my language of choice, as I believe that everything is better when written in Rust.

One of my strengths lies in deconstructing complex problems and developing solutions on a wide spectrum, ranging from programming challenges to team management. I pride myself on being adept at navigating the intricacies of various situations to achieve the best possible outcomes.

My journey began with writing a C++ parser that decoded binary data from a blood sugar level monitoring device. Now, my primary focus lies in Java and Rust, and I find the process of creating software to be a fascinating adventure. It's not just about writing code for me; it's about effective collaboration and guiding my team to build top-quality software in record time. To me, the whole process is a true work of art.

As we embark on this journey together, I invite you to follow my experiences and insights on [Twitter][https://twitter.com/ivanbyte] and [YouTube][https://www.youtube.com/@IvanByteVideo]. Together, we'll explore the captivating world of software development and uncover its countless wonders.
